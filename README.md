## The J-Names' Pain Games

***Collaborative project for UF's CEN4721 (Human-Centered Interactions)***

*In modern society, one of the biggest forms of entertainment is the act of playing video games. 
With multiple different gaming styles and devices, it is easy for people to get lost when trying to decide which device and gameplay format is best for them.*

To assist with their decision, our project aims to determine which playstyle is best fitted for a simple rpg platform game based on different input controls. ðŸŽ®
